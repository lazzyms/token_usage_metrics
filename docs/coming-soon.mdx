### Database Request Form

To request support for a new database backend, please open a GitHub issue with the following information:

**Issue Title:** `[Database Request] <Database Name>`

**Information to Include:**

1. **Database Name**: What database do you want supported?
2. **Use Case**: How would you use this database with Token Usage Metrics?
3. **Priority**: Is this blocking your adoption? (High/Medium/Low)
4. **Existing Driver**: Any recommended Python async drivers?
5. **Additional Context**: Anything else we should know?

<Info>
  We prioritize database support based on community demand and use cases. The
  more details you provide, the better we can plan implementation!
</Info>

### Example Request

```markdown
**Database Name**: MySQL

**Use Case**: Our organization already uses MySQL for all applications,
and we'd prefer to keep everything in one database system.

**Priority**: Medium - We can use PostgreSQL for now, but would prefer MySQL

```
